# Money Managers
Money Managers is our idea that gives the youth access to controlled spending with parental controls alongside financial literacy education. Parents can monitor child
activities, while the child can use the account to save, spend, and learn how the financial world works. Children accounts will obtain a user score which will be used to help guide the child through how to manage their finances well. This in addition to benefits will incentivise children within the program
to form long-term financial relationships with PNC. 

This Angular application is a prototype that contains some features that would be a part of this program, on both the parent and child side.

# Login
The login page will be used to authenticate the user and confirm their role as parent or child. Users that are timed out will be redirected to this page.

# Accounts
Children accounts will arrive at this page on login. They will have access to their checking and savings account information. The checking account will have a parent-assigned
budget, with the child having the ability to increase it. The savings account will have depositing available, with withdrawals requiring a request. Reports regarding spending as well
as the user score will also be accessed here.

# Leaderboard
The leaderboard page is where the child can see the user scores of others alongside their own. This can be filtered by State, City, (Age, and time as someone in Money Manager). 
In addition, a line chart following the child's user score will be shown.

# Courses
This is where child accounts can access financial literacy courses. These are organized on certain tracks, with courses in a row around a similar topic. Courses will have a chapter format and prerequisites, as well as give the account credits upon completion that will factor into the user score.

# Settings
Child accounts settings that can updated include contact info, display username, password, and notification settings.

# Home - Parent Exclusive
The home page is where parent accounts arrive on login, constructed like the mobile banking app with the addition of a section dedicated to registered child accounts. Here parents
can access other pages visible to the child

# Accounts, Leaderboard Parent Side
The parent can view the child accounts page to view their progress, as well as the leaderboard page with similar filters.

# Parental Controls
Parents on this page can manage their linked child account's budget, withdrawl limit, as well as general account access.

# Settings Parent Side
The parent settings page includes the same controls as the child account but for their own (change username, password, notifications) but also includes the parental controls previously mentioned.
